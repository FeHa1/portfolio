I integrated FontAwesome for icons and used Bootstrap along with Tailwind CSS for a responsive design. HTTP requests were handled with React-Axios, and I optimized the project through React Scripts from Create React App. I implemented tests with Jest and React Testing Library to ensure functionality and used TypeScript for clean, well-structured code, measured and optimized."

Built with React and React Router DOM for dynamic navigation, the app uses Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap for responsive design, and Axios for secure data handling. React Query synchronizes client data, with form validation by React Hook Form and Yup. TypeScript and Jest ensure quality code and reliable functionality, with Vite and ESLint streamlining development."
